        as multilingual. All documents associated with those templates are then
        accessible in multiple languages via different URLs. The different language
        versions can be distinguished by root folder name or by server name.
        Unlike other multilingual solutions, it is NOT necessary to manage multiple
        document trees with YAMS. Instead, all content for all languages is stored
        in template variables in the multilingual documents. YAMS has a ManagerManager
        extension that will organise the template variables for different languages
        onto different tabs. YAMS is also capable of creating and managing the
        multilingual template variables automatically. Whether or not a template
        is multilingual can be configured simply via the module interface.</p>
        <p>Multi-language content for the main document variables (pagetitle,
        longtitle, description, introtext, menutitle, content) is handled automatically
        and transparently and is subject to normal MODx caching. No special syntax
        is required for these document variables. For example, use
        <code>[*content*]</code> and the correct language content will appear.</p>
        <p>In addition, YAMS provides a range of placeholders which provide access
        to the language tag (for use in <code>lang=&quot;&quot;</code> or
        <code>xml:lang=&quot;&quot;</code>), the language direction (for use in
        <code>dir=&quot;&quot;</code>), language name and which allow the insertion
        of multilingual URLs for the current or any other document.  These can be
        used throughout the site, including in snippet templates.</p>
        <p>More advanced functionality is available via the YAMS snippet call.
        For example, via the snippet call it is possible to repeat content over
        multiple languages using templates. It is also possible to generate language
        lists or drop-down boxes in order to change language.</p>
        <p>Since snippets are generally responsible for parsing the placeholders
        in templates supplied to them, like <code>[&#43;pagetitle&#43;]</code> for
        example, they wont automatically know to insert the correct multilingual
        content. For Ditto I have overcome this by writing an extender which fixes
        this issue. For the templates of other snippets it is possible to overcome
        this problem by replacing these placeholders by special YAMS snippet calls, eg:
        <br />
        <code>[[YAMS? &amp;get=`content` &amp;from=`pagetitle` &amp;docid=`[&#43;id&#43;]`]]</code><br />
        I have provided YAMS compatible default templates for Wayfinder which
        already include the appropriate YAMS snippet calls.</p>
        <p>As of version 1.0.3, YAMS *should be* fully compatible with
        <a href="http://modxcms.com/forums/index.php/topic,32807.0.html" target="_blank">EasyLingual</a>.

        you will identify the different languages groups in the URL.
        There are three modes that can be used: <strong>Server Name</strong> mode,
        <strong>Root Name</strong> mode and <strong>Query Param</strong> mode.
        Whatever combination of modes you choose, the full URL
        must be unique for each language and you will need to configure your server settings appropriately.</p>
        <h3>Server Name and Root Name modes</h3>
        <p><strong>Server Name</strong> mode and <strong>Root Name</strong> mode can be used simultaneously or independently.
        The general format of the URL when using these modes is:<br />
        <code>http://(server_name)/(root_name)/(path/)(filename)</code><br />
        where there is only a path if friendly alias paths have been configured.</p>

      <p>When server name mode is OFF the server name is determined
        in the normal way MODx determines it and so is consistent with MODx [(site_url)].
        Server name mode is switched ON by specifying a different server name for each
        language group and a server name for monolingual/ordinary pages on the Language Settings tab.
        To use server name mode, you will have to configure the
        various server names as aliases or virtual hosts on your server.</p>

      <p>To enable root name mode, you just need to specify at least
        one root name on the Language Settings tab. If server name mode
        is OFF then you will need to specify one per language group.</p>

      <p>In either of these modes it is possible to change the language of a page
      by sending a request back to current page with the id of the new
      language group specified with a GET or POST variable. By default this variable is
      called yams_new_lang, but it can be configured on the Other Params tab. There is
      also a placeholder that can be used to access this name and snippet calls that
      will generate a list or drop down box to enable changing the language.
     </p>

      <h3>Query Param mode</h3>
      <p><strong>Query Param</strong> mode is provided primarily for compatibility
        with EasyLingual and cannot be used in conjunction with the other modes.
        In this mode there is no root name and the server name is identical for all
        language groups. So, to distinguish one language from another a query parameter
        is appended to all URLs:<br />
        <code>http://server_name/(path/)filename?yams_lang=id</code></p>
      <p>
        By default this query param is called yams_lang.
        However, it is configurable on the Other Options tab.
        Change it to <code>lang</code> for compatibility with EasyLingual.</p>');

    , '<p>The second step is to configure the language settings for
          each language group that will be used on your multilingual pages. This
          is done on the language settings tab.</p>

        <p>Each language group has an id. This is used, for example, in the
        multilingual versions of the template variables for that language.
        Eg: <code>description_<em>id</em></code></p>

        <p>A language group can be set up to represent a group of languages (en),
        a specific localised language (en-gb) or a selection of localised languages
        (en-gb,en-us,...) by specifying a comma separated list of language tags.</p>

        <p>In addition to this and the server name and root name for each language
        group, you can specify the language direction and the text associated with
        each language. You can also associate a MODx language name with the language
        group.</p>

        <p>You will now need to set up one language group as the default language
        group. This language will be assumed for non-multilingual pages.</p>' );

          query parameter. To help with this, YAMS provides you with
          text that you can copy and paste. See the Server Config tab.
          As a bonus, this text will tell YAMS the current language
          via a query parameter, which saves it from having to
          figure it out from the URL later.</p>

        <p>You will have to update your server config every time you
          activate or deactivate a language group, change its

        normal URLs otherwise. Links to real files like images are not affected
        by the YAMS module and do not need to be converted. To convert an URL
        you use the YAMS placeholders.</p>
        <p>The recommended way of specifying URLs in documents is<br />
          <code>(yams_doc:<em>docId</em>)</code> or <code>(yams_docr:<em>docId</em>)</code><br />
          and in templates is<br />
          <code>(yams_doc:[&#43;<em>docId</em>&#43;])</code> or <code>(yams_docr:[&#43;<em>docId</em>&#43;])</code>.
        </p>
        <p>This will provide a full absolute URL to the given document. The
        <code>yams_docr</code> version will additionally resolve weblinks if that
        is required. These two placeholders can be configured not to output the
        filename of the document for the site start. See the \'Other Params\' tab.
        This approach will work for all YAMS setups and is not dependent on a
        particular base meta tag setting.</p>
        <p>However, if you are ONLY using root name mode and are not planning on
        using server name mode in the future then you may find it simpler to prefix
        the page alias by the root name instead. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>[~<em>docId</em>~]</code> becomes <code>(yams_root/:<em>docId</em>)[~<em>docId</em>~]</code></li>
          <li><code>[~[&#43;<em>docId</em>&#43;]~]</code> becomes <code>(yams_root/:[&#43;<em>docId</em>&#43;])[~[&#43;<em>docId</em>&#43;]~]</code></li>
          <li><code>[(site_url)][~<em>docId</em>~]</code> becomes <code>[(site_url)](yams_root/:<em>docId</em>)[~<em>docId</em>~]</code></li>
          <li><code>[(base_url)][~<em>docId</em>~]</code> becomes <code>[(base_url)](yams_root/:<em>docId</em>)[~<em>docId</em>~]</code></li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could of course choose to include the root name in the base meta
        tag (by setting the href attribute to <code>(yams_site)</code> for example.)
        However, please be aware that in that case you will have to provide a
        complete URL to all file based resources. For example:
        <code>[(site_url)]assets/images/...</code></p>

        If it is not, then take a look at the EasyLingual tab for info about
        the EasyLingual compatibility placeholders. If that still does not solve
        your problem them please post a message to the YAMS forum thread. Some
        additional adjustments may be needed or there may be a bug.</p>' );
